# Instructions for using SD-NSGA
* The program of our algorithm is in SD-N SGA.m
* Traditional NSGA program for NSGA3Basic.m
* Multi_population_CSGA3.m is a program for multi platation NSGA
* Input_info8.m is used to extract data that can be traversed through scenes, and will be called when three algorithm programs are running
* The design10task.mat includes real data obtained through traversal
