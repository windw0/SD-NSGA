# SD-NSGA
## Introduction
SD-NSGA is a multi-objective optimization genetic algorithm based on subspecies differentiation strategy
* The program of our algorithm is in SD-N SGA.m
* Traditional NSGA program for NSGA3Basic.m
* Multi_population_CSGA3.m is a program for multi platation NSGA
* Input_info8.m is used to extract data that can be traversed through scenes, and will be called when three algorithm programs are running
* The design10task.mat includes real data obtained through traversal

## Test platform
* Windows 11
* CPU:Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 5218
* Matlab 2023a
